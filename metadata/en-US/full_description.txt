RSAF is an Android document provider for the wonderful rclone. It allows any app that supports Android's Storage Access Framework (SAF) to access remote files via rclone's backends.

RSAF is not itself a file manager, but any file manager supporting SAF, including the one built into Android (Settings -> Storage -> Documents), can make use of it.
